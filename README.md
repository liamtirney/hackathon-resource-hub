# hackathon-resource-hub
Attend Hacks for Hackers hackathon where the goal is to "build creative projects that empower you and your fellow hackers to do more".

### Inspiration
We want to help make it easy for newcomers to participate and enjoy hackathons.

### What it does
The Hackathon Resource Hub provides tutorials, APIs, and user stories for hackathon participants to explore and ultimately interact with.

### How we built it
We used React, Material UI, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB and Mongoose for the database.

### Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenges were some merge conflict issues and passing certain data through from the backend to the frontend, but we successfully resolved them and learned a lot from dealing with them.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is was our first hackathon. It was a new and challenging experience, but our goal was to focus on learning above all else and we did just that.

### What we learned
We gained experience across the stack as we split tasks up so each person could work on each part of the project.

### What's next for Hackathon Resource Hub
We plan to complete the application and deploy it before our next hackathon.
