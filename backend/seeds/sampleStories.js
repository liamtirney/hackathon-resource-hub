    body: "My name is Tania. I made websites for fun as a child. I went to college for a career that wasn't right for me, but I learned a lot about myself and life, as well as having a great appreciation for what I do now." +
      "The hardest part of all was doing the necessary soul searching to try to figure out what would be the right career for me, both in natural aptitude and enjoyability." +
      "While still working my as a Chef, I found odd jobs through Craigslist in the web development industry to begin building up my resume and learning, while still making money." +
      "I did a three month unpaid internship while working a night job when I became really serious about my career change." +
      "The biggest thing that helped me was making a blog to document everything I learned, and I would recommend the same to anyone who wants to learn." +
      "I applied for jobs online while continuing to study, learn, and create, and eventually I was able to land a full-time junior web developer role." +
      "The seed of an idea for a career change began in August, 2014, and I began my first job in June, 2015, making my career transition 10 months long." +
      "My dream is to summarize everything I've learned into an effective web development course from scratch for beginners, so they don't have to search through as many poor and outdated tutorials as I did.",
